    "Mouse Bite": "Mouse bite defects in PCBs, also known as breakaway tabs, are small perforations or slots along the edge of the board intended to facilitate easy separation of individual PCBs from a larger panel. These perforations can lead to rough edges or burrs. Proper design and manufacturing practices can help minimize these issues.",
    "Spurious": "Spurious defects in PCBs refer to unintended and unexpected signals or noise that interfere with the normal operation of the circuit. These defects can be caused by design flaws, manufacturing imperfections, or external electromagnetic interference. To handle spurious defects, ensure robust design practices, use high-quality materials, and implement shielding or filtering techniques to reduce noise and interference."
